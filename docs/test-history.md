# History of check runs

Every completed full run while building versions 1.1 to 1.7.1. A "full run" is one execution of `check.bat` (or `python check.py`), which runs the whole test suite and passes only if every test passes; a skipped test counts as a failure. Each run appends a row to `docs/check_history.md`. Your own runs are logged there, and that file stays on your PC.

For how the tests are organized and how to run them, see [Testing](development/testing.md).
