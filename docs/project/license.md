### Exact versions in release 1.7.1

- FFmpeg `n8.1.3-34-ga35157abb9-20261105`
- mpv `v0.42.0-1-g3138fc8ee`, built 2026-11-05

[`tools/vendor.lock.json`](https://github.com/tophe323/ClipShrink/blob/main/tools/vendor.lock.json) records exactly which builds these are, with their checksums.

### Source code

The exact source of FFmpeg, mpv, Qt and the libraries inside them is in the [third-party-1.5.1 release](https://github.com/tophe323/ClipShrink/releases/tag/third-party-1.5.1), along with the build recipes.

### License texts

The `licenses` folder installed with ClipShrink holds them. `licenses/COMPONENTS.md` lists every library inside FFmpeg and mpv, with the commit it came from. mpv's build follows each project's newest code, so apart from mpv, FFmpeg and libplacebo, its commits are the newest ones when that build started.

Qt also ships `opengl32sw.dll` (Mesa, MIT license), and Python needs Microsoft's Visual C++ runtime files, which Microsoft allows to be redistributed with apps.

## Trademarks

GoPro, Google Drive, NVIDIA and Netflix are trademarks of their owners. ClipShrink is an independent project, not affiliated with or endorsed by any of them.
