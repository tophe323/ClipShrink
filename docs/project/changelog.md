# Changelog

Every released version of ClipShrink, newest first. The authoritative file is [CHANGELOG.md on GitHub](https://github.com/tophe323/ClipShrink/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md).

## 1.7.1 - 2026-11-10

### Added
- **Reports show times:** when each file started and finished, and how long it took. Under the table, the batch's start, end and total time, the encoder, and the PC's graphics card, processor and Windows version.

### Fixed
- **Reports open in columns in Excel** on PCs set to French, Dutch, German and other languages that separate lists with `;`. Reports now use the PC's own separator and decimal symbol.
- **Videos whose picture starts after the sound**, such as some Webex recordings, failed with "Stream map '' matches no streams". They now convert, and stay in sync.
- **.MTS camcorder files** all failed with "invalid literal for int()". They now convert.
- **Some phone videos kept their original** with "duration differs" by a few hundredths of a second, although no frame was lost. The check now compares the time of every frame's start, first to last, instead of the length the file reports, which an encoder's start delay can skew. A conversion that really changes timing is still refused.
- **A failed VMAF comparison now says why**, with FFmpeg's exit code, instead of an empty reason.

## 1.7 - 2026-11-07

### Added
- **Seven languages:** English, French, Dutch, German, Spanish, Italian and Portuguese. Choose at the top of Settings; it applies at once, with no restart. English is the default. The installer offers the same languages. Reports are written in the chosen language. The translations haven't yet been checked by native speakers.
- **Open file location:** right-click a row on any table to open its folder in Explorer, with the file highlighted.
- **Tick like in Explorer** on Compare and clean up: Ctrl+click ticks one row, Shift+click a range, Ctrl+A everything that can be deleted. A plain click still only picks the row to play.
- **200% and 400% zoom** in the side by side player, beside 100%, with each pixel shown as a block.
- **Drag to look around** at 100%, 200% and 400%. Both sides move together.

### Changed
- **Settings and About share one page**, in two columns. The sidebar now has a single Settings button.
- **Back to the defaults** sits in the Advanced card, and leaves the language as it is.

### Fixed
- **Clicking the player's progress bar** now jumps to that point. Before, only dragging the handle worked.

## 1.6.1 - 2026-11-07

### Added
- **Welcome screen** when the app opens, with a Choose folder button that goes straight to step 1. You can turn it off.
- **Tooltips on VMAF average and Worst 1%**, on the See the saving, Convert and Compare pages, explaining what they mean.

### Changed
- **Resizable columns on every table.** Columns fit their content until you drag one.

### Fixed
- **Generic icon on the taskbar.** The installed app no longer sets the taskbar ID that was the likely cause. This has yet to be confirmed on a PC showing the problem.

## 1.6 - 2026-11-06

### Added
- **Advanced settings:** your own VMAF values for the warning, an option to aim for them, and an optional minimum below which nothing is kept. Locked until you confirm you understand. The defaults stay at 95 / 90 with no minimum.
- **Start Over:** after step 4, forget these files and go back to step 1.
- **Already has a conversion:** an H.264 file with a real H.265 or AV1 conversion beside it isn't ticked. This is decided from the folder, with no memory.
- **An icon**, on the app, its shortcuts, the taskbar and the installer.
- **Settings names your graphics card**, and greys it out with a reason if it can't make the chosen format.

### Changed
- **ClipShrink forgets files once a batch is finished.** Exiting or clicking Start Over drops all file status, so changes made outside the app can't confuse it, such as restoring an original over its conversion. An unfinished batch is still remembered for crash recovery. Your existing history is discarded on update. Originals can only be removed through the app for the batch you just ran.
- **Converting starts by itself:** the See the saving page's button is now Start converting, and the Start button on the Convert page is gone.
- **About** moved to the bottom of the sidebar. It now holds the documentation link, a clickable reports folder and the "What does "no quality loss" mean?" explanation, which replaces its own button.
- **"Clears the bar?" is now "Meets the quality target?"**, and "target" replaces "bar" throughout.

### Removed
- **Reports & Statistics.** Each batch still leaves a CSV report in the reports folder, for your information. Lifetime statistics and in-app XLSX and PDF export are gone, along with the openpyxl library.

## 1.5.1 - 2026-11-06

### Changed
- **Licence information is complete.** The app now installs a `licenses` folder with the licence texts of what it bundles, and the exact source code of FFmpeg, mpv and Qt is published with the release.

Nothing else changed, including how videos are converted.

## 1.5 - 2026-11-06

### Fixed
- **Broken sound in some MOV files.** Cameras such as Nikon can store uncompressed (PCM) sound in a way ClipShrink misread, so it copied only a quarter of the sound and the result played as loud noise. The check made the same mistake, so these conversions were marked Verified. The picture was not affected. This applies to every version from 1.1 to 1.4.1. If you converted such files, listen to them, and keep their originals until you have. Conversions with AAC sound, which most phones and GoPro cameras use, were not affected.

### Added
- **GoPro LRV clean-up.** When Find videos finds LRV preview files with their original video beside them, a pop-up explains what they are and offers to send them to the Recycle Bin. An LRV file with no original beside it is always kept.

### Changed
- **New file names.** Conversions now end in `_(h265)` or `_(av1)`. A shrunk one also gets its size, for example `_(1080p)_(h265)`. Files you already converted keep their names.
- **Compare and clean up lists this session only.** It shows the videos found or converted since you opened the app, not your whole history. Reports & Statistics still covers everything.
- **The side-by-side player starts by itself**, and the space bar pauses and resumes it, whichever button is highlighted.
- **Click the current step to go back.** From Settings, About, Reports & Statistics or What does "no quality loss" mean?, click the step you are on in the left pane. The quality explanation is now a page instead of a separate window.

## 1.4.1 - 2026-11-06

### Fixed
- The app could crash with "duplicate column name" or "database is locked" when two parts of it opened its database at the same moment, most likely on a first start after updating or on a new install.

## 1.4 - 2026-11-06

### Added
- **Settings** page, remembered between runs. The defaults suit most people.
- Choose the graphics card or the processor. This moved here from the See the saving page. The graphics card is the default, with the processor as the fallback.
- **AV1** as an alternative to H.265, which stays the default. These files end in `_AV1`.
- **Largest size:** shrink big videos to 4K, 1080p or 720p. Videos are never enlarged. Each is checked against a shrunken copy of its original and labelled Resized, and removing its original needs an extra confirmation.
- An optional **Encoding** column with format, quality setting, resolution and bitrate. Reports now list these too.

### Changed
- A new look: summary cards and thin progress bars on the Convert page, filter tabs, status pills and ticks in the sidebar.

### Fixed
- The "Continue where you left off?" prompt could appear after a batch had already started.

## 1.3 - 2026-11-06

### Changed

- **Below the bar no longer blocks a conversion.** A file that can't reach VMAF average 95 and worst 1% 90 at the best setting is still converted, and gets a warning sign. Its original stays until you choose otherwise, and removing it needs an extra confirmation. A result that isn't smaller still keeps the original.
- The automatic report replaces the Save report button.

### Added

- A report is kept automatically for every batch, in a reports folder.
- **Reports & Statistics** page: space saved since you started using the app, average file reduction and more, with reports you can export as CSV, XLSX or PDF, or delete.
- **About** page.
- **Select All** and **Select Recommended** buttons on the Compare and clean up page.
- Click any column title to sort, by its real value.
- A Folder column showing where each file is.
- Progress bars while deleting and renaming.

### Removed

- The Google Drive trash warnings.

## 1.2 - 2026-11-05

### Changed

- The app's wording now covers any H.264 video, not only GoPro files.
- The Google Drive warning now says it applies only to videos stored in Drive.

### Fixed

- The Convert page no longer says "1 videos".
- If the video player stops unexpectedly, the app now shows a message instead of an error crash.

## 1.1 - 2026-11-05

First public release.

### Added

- H.265 and other non-H.264 videos are listed on the Find videos page, greyed out and marked as skipped.
- **Remove _H265 from names** gives a conversion its original's name once the original is in the Recycle Bin.
- The version number shows in the window title.

### Fixed

- Windows dark theme hid tick boxes, the selected row and the report text. The app now always uses its light look.
- Clicking anywhere in a tick box's cell now ticks it.

## 1.0 - 2026-11-05

Private first version: scan, sample-based savings estimate, batch conversion with pause and crash recovery, VMAF verification, side by side playback and Recycle Bin cleanup.
